        <h2>A Rich History</h2>
        <img src="about.jpg" alt="Historical Image of the Park" class="full-width">
        <p>
            Established in <strong>1892</strong>, Mountain View Park was originally a protected nature reserve. 
            The area has a rich history, including traces of Roman occupation and later medieval farming settlements. 
            Ancient walking paths through the park have been preserved for visitors to enjoy.
